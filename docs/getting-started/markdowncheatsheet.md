# Markdown for Madison
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a web language that allows anyone to easily create content online that web applications like Madison can use. Everything you can't do with a PDF or Word Document, you can do with Markdown. Madison's dual-display editor lets you see how your document will look as you're formatting it.

## Styling Text With Markdown
### Line Breaks
Enter two spaces at the end of a line of text to create a line break.

### Paragraphs
To create separate paragraphs, add a blank line between sentences by hitting enter twice. To indent a paragraph, enter four spaces of the first line of the paragraph.

### Headers
You can create up to six levels of headers. Highlight the line you want and click the header icon. Clicking repeatedly changes to level of header. All content formatted as Header 1 automatically becomes a section in the Table of Contents.

* Note: you cannot underline text in Markdown.

## Listed Items
### Bulleted Items
You have two choices
1. Click on 'Bulleted List' icon at the top of the page.
2. Enter an asterisk (*) followed by one space, in front of each list item.

### Numbered Items
You have two choices:
1. Click on the 'Numbered List' icon at the top of the page.
2. Enter a number, followed by one space, in front of each list item.

Note that you must enter the asterisk or number in front of each item in the list.

### Block Quotes
You have two choices:
1. CLick the icon at the top of the page. To indent further, click the icon again.
2. Enter > in front of the first word. To indent further, add another >.

This styling will affect the entire paragraph, but once you add a blank line and start a new paragraph the styling will return to normal.

### Link to text
If you want to link to an external source, place the URL within a set of brackets.

### Images
The only way to insert an image into Markdown is to link to its location online. Madison allows you to do this with a helpful icon at the top of the page.

If you want to use a symbol in your content that Markdown uses to create styling, such as an asterisk, simply place a backslash in front of the symbol. For example: /*emphasis/*
