## Best Practices/Tips
#### Timing
* It's best to release documents in Madison 2-4 weeks before a major action point, such as a public hearing
* It's also helpful ot choose a specific time-frame when you will accept comments on Madison, and to clearly communicate that time-frame in all outreach efforts

#### Outreach- Crucial to Success on Madison
* Use existing community groups, activists, and policy experts to start the conversation and spread the word about participating on Madison
  * Use existing hashtags from those communities to spread the word on social media
  * Tweet out good annotations and comments-- you can link directly to annotations
  * Add a few comments of your own directly on the bill to show your presence and start the discussion
* Coordinate with committee staffers in charge of soliciting public testimony for hearings
* Include information on using Madison in every public announcement and press release on the document
* Include in outreach materials a short video of the Council Member inviting community members to use Madison

#### Additional Outreach Ideas
* Small, in-person sessions at public libraries, community centers, universities, and coffee shops incorporating Madison, with laptops/desktops/iPads where participants can read the bill and add their ideas
* Video endorsements from other Council Members
* A 'live online public hearing' where community members can watcht the streaming video of a public hearing and send questions in via Madison for Council Members to address in the session
* Google Hangouts between the Council Members and community members around the bill on Madison

## Managing Madison
#### Staying engaged with users
* It's helpful to assign a staffer to check Madison a few times a week to monitor traffic and respond to questions

#### Submitting Comments to the Public Record
 * At the end of the commenting time-period export comments and annotations and submit them to the staffer in charge of collecting testimony. They should be able t incorporate that information in the public record as they would read emails.
   * Currently you will need to email us to do this, but we are building an exporting feature that will be available in about two months
